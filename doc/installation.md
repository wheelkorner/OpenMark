## Installation

### Requirements

We work on stable, supported and up-to-date versions of packages. We recommend you to do the same.

| Package       | Version |
|---------------|---------|
| PHP           | \>8.0   |
| sylius/sylius | 1.11.x  |
| MySQL         | \>= 5.7 |

----

The Open Marketplace application can serve as a foundation for your custom e-commerce marketplace application.

Before creating your application, make sure you use at least PHP 8.0 and have Composer installed.

**Be aware. The project has currently a strong reference to Sylius eCommerce platform. If you have not discovered the solution yet, it is worth at least taking a look at the official Sylius documentation.**

### 1. Create project

```diff
$ composer create-project bitbag/open-marketplace project
$ cd project
```

Open Marketplace as an application based on Sylius is using environment variables which configure connection
with database, mailer services, vendor products limits, vendor logo directory
and directory of files uploaded through messages. Default values are stored in `.env` file
and you can customise them by creating `.env.local` file with variables that you want to change.

 > For mailer to work properly you need to customise `MAILER_URL` in your `env.local`

 > For database to work properly you need to customise `DATABASE_URL` in your `env.local` with your database credentials

Creating database for your project

```diff
$ bin/console doctrine:database:create
$ bin/console doctrine:schema:create
```
### 2. Install & build assets

```diff
$ yarn install
$ yarn encore dev
$ bin/console assets:install 
```
You can also use  `yarn watch`  to observe and build resources after saving files.

### 3. Run the app

```diff
$ symfony server:start // or symfony serve -d --no-tls
```

### 4. Load fixtures

```diff
$ bin/fixtures
```

**Note: If you do not want to use our mockup data and prefer a clean installation instead, follow the Sylius installation guide [here](https://docs.sylius.com/en/latest/getting-started-with-sylius/installation.html#project-setup:~:text=To%20launch%20a%20Sylius%20application%20initial%20data%20has%20to%20be%20set%20up%3A%20an%20administrator%20account%20and%20base%20locale.%20Run%20the%20Sylius%20installation%20command%20to%20do%20that.).**

## Optional steps

### 5. Run tests

Creating database for your test environment.

```diff
$ bin/console doctrine:database:create --env=test
$ bin/console doctrine:schema:create --env=test
```
